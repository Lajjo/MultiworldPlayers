accessibility:
  items: 1 # item accessibility means you can get all inventory items. So a key could lock itself, but you can fill your inventory
  locations: 1 # location accessibility means you can access every location in your seed and get all 216 checks
  none: 0 # no accessibility means your seed is "beatable only", meaning any items you do not need to beat the game can be unreachable. This can mean you have to defeat ganon with a lamp and master sword.
progressive: #not available in bonta's multiworld at this time. If you want this option, make sure the host uses the correct Multiworld
  on: 4 # progressive items, you will always get progressive items like swords in their order: figher sword -> master sword -> tempered sword -> golden sword
  off: 0 # turns progressive items off, so you can find, for example, silver arrows before a bow
  random: 0 # rolls a 50/50 chance for each potentially progressive item. So, for example, you can have progressive swords but non-progressive mittens
